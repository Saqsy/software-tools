# System Administration

[lecture slides](./slides.md)

Your first week on this unit is focused on the basics of POSIX system
administration. In particular, you'll be getting set up with tools that
you'll be using throughout this unit: the SSH setup that will allow you to
access lab machines remotely, and the Vagrant container system that sets up the
virtual Debian environment that this unit's exercises are developed against.
We'll also be showing you how to install software on your Debian VM, and helping
you choose a text editor.

## Pre-reading

There are some common pitfalls at this stage in the unit, and in partcular
students often get confused by standard SSH output.  Please watch [this
supplementary
video](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/me17847_bristol_ac_uk/EU8xAeeT1x5fKcyWtWoAyYwBTQBfFbs3L93Xjgcvt1A9XA?e=7cgdcl)
([slides](./SSH.pdf)) before the lab. As with all weeks, it is also a good idea to
look at the exercises below before the start of the lab itself.


## Exercises

1. [Secure shell](./lab/ssh.md)
2. [Installing vagrant and Debian](./lab/install.md)
3. [Debian system administration](./lab/admin.md)
